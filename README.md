Snake Game: 
This is a recreation of the classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game allows players to control a snake as it moves around the screen, 
collecting fruits to grow longer while avoiding collisions. 
The player earns points by eating the fruits, and the game ends when the snake hits an obstacle.

Features: 
Classic Snake Gameplay: Move the snake using arrow keys to eat fruits and avoid obstacles.
Fruits and Traps: Randomly spawning fruits increase your score, and traps randomly appear to increase the challenge.
High Score Tracking: The game tracks your high score, which is saved to the browserâ€™s local storage and persists between sessions.
Game Reset: Includes a reset button to restart the game at any time without refreshing the page.

How to Play: 
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
Eat the fruits to increase your score and length. Each fruit eaten adds one point to your score.
Avoid hitting the walls, the snake's body, or traps, which will end the game.
Your high score is displayed at the top of the game, and will be saved even after you refresh the page or restart the game.

Technologies Used: 
HTML: For structuring the game and user interface.
CSS: For styling the game and making it responsive.
JavaScript: For the game logic, including movement, collision detection, scoring, and updating the canvas.

Acknowlegments: 
Inspired by the classic Snake game, a staple of early computer games.
